An Operating System in C.

A CPU scheduler determines an order for the execution of its scheduled processes.

The OS implements the following scheduling algorithms:

- First Come First Serve (FCFS)
- Shortest Job First (SJF)
- Preemptive Highest Priority First (HPF)
- Shortest Remaining Time Next (SRTN)
- Round Robin (RR)
<br/>
The OS also allocates memory to processes according to these algorithms:

- First Fit
- Next Fit
- Best Fit
- Buddy System Allocation
